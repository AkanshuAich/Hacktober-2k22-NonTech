Adobe XD has the advantage of being part of the Adobe Creative Suite. This means that it integrates well with other Adobe products, making it a good choice for those already familiar with the Adobe ecosystem. It also has a wide range of features and an intuitive interface.

Figma, on the other hand, is a web-based application that makes it easy to share projects and collaborate with others. It’s also free to use, which could be a deciding factor for some designers.

So, which one should you choose? Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and what works best for your workflow.

If you’re already familiar with Adobe products, then Adobe XD is a great choice. If you prefer a web-based application or want to save on costs, then Figma could be the better option.
